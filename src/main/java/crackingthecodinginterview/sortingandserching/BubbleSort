Start at the beginning of an array and swap the first two elements if the first is bigger than the second. Go to the next pair, etc, continuously making sweeps of the array until sorted. O(n^2).

We can create a java program to sort array elements using bubble sort. Bubble sort algorithm is known as the simplest sorting algorithm.

In bubble sort algorithm, array is traversed from first element to last element. Here, current element is compared with the next element. If current element is greater than the next element, it is swapped.
