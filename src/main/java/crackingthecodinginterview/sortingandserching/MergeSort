Merge sort is a “divide and conquer” algorithm wherein we first divide the problem into subproblems. When the solutions for the subproblems are ready, we combine them together to get the final solution to the problem.

This is one of the algorithms which can be easily implemented using recursion as we deal with the subproblems rather than the main problem.

The algorithm can be described as the following 2 step process:

Divide: In this step, we divide the input array into 2 halves, the pivot being the midpoint of the array. This step is carried out recursively for all the half arrays until there are no more half arrays to divide.
Conquer: In this step, we sort and merge the divided arrays from bottom to top and get the sorted array.
The following diagram shows the complete merge sort process for an example array {10, 6, 8, 5, 7, 3, 4}.
