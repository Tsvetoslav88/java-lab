Builder pattern is used to create a complex object using simple objects. It creates the bigger object step by step from small and simple object.

Builder pattern is another creational pattern.

For example, when creating a window as our application's main window, we need to create a menu, a toolbar and then add the menu and toolbar.

For each window we are going to create, we need to create an empty window, create a menu, create a toolbar, install the menu and toolbar to the window.

We can use the builder pattern to hide the implementation of how to create a window.
