Singleton pattern is a creational pattern.

This pattern involves only a single class which is responsible to creates its own object.

The class ensures that only single object get created.

This class provides a way to access its only object.

For example, when design a user interface, we may only have one main application windows. We can use the Singleton Pattern to ensure that there is only one instance of the MainApplicationWindow object.
