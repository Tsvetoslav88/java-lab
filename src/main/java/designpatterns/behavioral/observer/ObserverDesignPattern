Observer pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified, 
its depenedent objects are to be notified automatically. Observer pattern falls under behavioral pattern category.

When to use the Observer Pattern:
Use the Observer pattern in any of the following situations:
* When an abstraction has two aspects, one dependent on the other. Encapsulating these
aspects in separate objects lets you vary and reuse them independently.
* When a change to one object requires changing others, and you don’t know how many
objects need to be changed?
* When an object should be able to notify other objects without making assumptions about
who these objects are. In other words, you don’t want these objects tightly coupled.
